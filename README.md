# PKI-Lab-
Step-by-step annotations are within the document narrating what I've done throughout my personal project.

PSA- It was a large file that I had to compress to be able to upload to GitHub so the screenshot images might not show up in GH, You might have to download them to view. 

This project documents the setup and implementation of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in a controlled lab environment. The objective was to simulate the creation, management, and application of digital certificates to secure communication and authenticate systems within a network.

---

##  Lab Overview 

The lab involved setting up a Certificate Authority (CA), generating digital certificates, and configuring secure communication protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS using those certificates. The project provided hands-on experience with cryptographic key management, certificate signing, and establishing trust within a private network.
## TOOLS
-Ubuntu Server VM
-Ubuntu Server Terminal/Shell
-OpenSSL
-Firefox Browser
-Apache- configured web server to use SSL/TLS encryption
## Outcomes 

- Successfully deployed a functioning private CA and issued digital certificates 
- Configured HTTPS encryption on a local web server using PKI 
- Captured and analyzed SSL/TLS handshake traffic in **Wireshark** 
- Gained a practical understanding of public/private key cryptography and digital trust models

  ##  Lessons Learned 

- The foundational role of PKI in securing digital communications and system authentication 
- How SSL/TLS certificates are created, signed, and validated within a trust chain 
- The risks associated with expired, misconfigured, or improperly signed certificates 
- The process of encrypting HTTP traffic and verifying secure client-server communications
